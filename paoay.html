        <p>Paoay Church.</p>
        <p>It was founded by Augustinian missionaries in 1593, and was a labor of love over time and in the face of earthquakes and other disasters.

The Paoay Church history began in the 17th century. The construction of the church was spread over a century beginning from 1604: the cornerstone of the church was laid in 1704; the convent in 1707; and the belltower in 1793. Even while still unfinished, Paoay Church was already used by parishioners. In 1896, it was finally inaugurated. But in 1706 and 1927, it was damaged by earthquakes.

Its scars made it more beautiful and worth-visiting. Because of San Agustin Church Paoay’s historical and artistic significance, it was designated as a National Cultural Treasure by the Philippine government in 1973 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site among the country’s baroque churches in 1993.

Seeing it in person, you’d think it’s like straight out from a postcard. The sky above the church is often a deep cerulean making it a photographer’s haven. 

Paoay Church Ilocos Norte, overall, is an interesting design. It is adorned with eight pilasters and 24 extravagant coral-block buttresses and ornate stone finials that hold it up and protect it against earthquake damage.

The bell tower was intended to be constructed at a distance from the church to minimize damage should it fall.

According to historians, the bell tower served as a status symbol for the locals—the bell would ring more loudly and more times during the wedding of a prominent clan than it would during the wedding of the less privileged. It was also said to have been used as a Filipino watchtower during the 1898 uprising against the Spaniards.

        <p>In 1993, Paoay Church Ilocos Norte was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as one of the best examples of the Baroque Churches of the Philippines. The historical church is famous for its distinct architecture highlighted by the enormous buttresses.

Portions of the church were damaged by two major earthquakes. In 1973, it was designated as a National Cultural Treasure by the Philippine government. During an excavation inside the church in 2000, a prehistoric human skeleton and fragmented ceramics were discovered and are now on display at the National Museum. </p>
